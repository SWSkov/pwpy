# pwpy
Python script to create passwords and store them in an unsecure locker

A neat little script that can create a random, jumbled 15 character alphanumerical, upper-and-lower-case, password for you and store it in a dictionary to be used later. 

Put a batch file in your Windows folder that executes the script.

EX. Calling 'pw sam' from Win+R would create a key for 'sam' and copy the associated value on the first try. Calling 'pw sam' again would just copy the value associated with 'sam'.

Thanks to Al Sweigart for inspiration.
